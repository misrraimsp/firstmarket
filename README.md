## General Info

Nowadays we live immersed in the Internet society, making platforms that offer their products and services through the Internet an essential part of our
way of life. At the same time, the quality standards of this type of system have been raised, increasing productivity at development time, improving user experience day by day, and continuously reinforcing security, in all its aspects.

This Final Degree Project consists of the development of a book e-commerce web application, called FirstMarket. The goal has been to delve into the problems faced by these technologies and the modern ways of solving them, always keeping in mind the tools seen in the course of the study plan. The application developed allows both the user to go through the entire book purchase cycle (explore the catalog, manage the purchase through a virtual basket, make the payment, view the orders placed, etc.), as well as the store administrator to manage their products (add new books, modify existing ones, manage received orders, etc.).

A Java Servlet based client-server architecture has been used. The back end implementation has been done with Spring, specifically using its Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security modules. On the user presentation side, Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript have been the protagonists, creating a smooth and consistent user experience. Payments are managed through integration with Stripe platform, gaining robustness and security. Finally, the web application has been deployed to Heroku, acquiring and configuring its own domain name: [firstmarket.tech](https://firstmarket.tech "Visit FirstMarket").
