# FirstMarket - Final Degree Project
Bookstore that allows both users to go through the entire book purchase cycle (explore the catalog, manage the purchase through a
virtual basket, make the payment, view the orders placed, etc.), as well as the administrator to manage the store (add new books, modify
existing ones, manage received orders, control users, etc.).

A Java Servlet based client-server architecture has been used. The back end implementation has been done with Spring, specifically using its Spring Boot,
Spring Framework, Spring Data JPA and Spring Security modules. On the user presentation side, Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript have been the protagonists, creating a smooth and consistent user experience. Payments are managed through integration with Stripe platform, gaining robustness and security. Finally, the web application has been deployed to Heroku, acquiring and configuring its own domain name: [firstmarket.tech](https://firstmarket.tech "Visit FirstMarket").
